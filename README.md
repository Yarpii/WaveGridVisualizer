# WaveGridVisualizer

### 🌊 A Dynamic Sound-Driven Wave Grid Visualizer
**WaveGridVisualizer** is a real-time **3D wave visualization tool** that reacts to sound input. It uses **OpenGL shaders** to create animated waveforms with dynamic lighting and color effects.

## 🚀 Features
- 🎶 **Audio-Driven Wave Simulation** – Waveforms change shape and color based on sound properties.
- 🎨 **Dynamic Lighting & Shading** – Enhanced shading with Phong lighting and normal-based reflections.
- 🔄 **Camera Interactivity** – Rotate, pan, and zoom to explore the wave patterns.
- 🎛 **Real-Time Controls** – Adjust wave amplitude, frequency, and light effects dynamically.
- 🎨 **Customizable Color Schemes** – Cycle through different visual styles.
- 🔊 **Looping Sound Generation** – Supports multiple waveforms and harmonics.

## 🖥️ Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python and the required dependencies installed:
```sh
pip install pygame PyOpenGL numpy
```

## ▶️ Running the Visualizer
Simply execute the Python script:
```sh
python sound.py
```

## 🎮 Controls
| Key | Action |
|------|---------|
| `↑ / ↓` | Increase / Decrease frequency |
| `PgUp / PgDn` | Increase / Decrease amplitude |
| `F` | Toggle wireframe mode |
| `L` | Toggle dynamic light movement |
| `C` | Cycle through color presets |
| `WASD / QZ` | Move camera |
| `R` | Reset camera position |
| `Space` | Toggle auto-rotation |
| `M` | Toggle sound on/off |
| `Esc` | Quit the program |
